    \textbf{Opening Remarks:} Before you start reading, skim through and look at each definition.
    Every and anything that's bolded or underlined, and all the funky symbols. Ask yourself
    ``What does this mean?'' Then move on without giving it thought. This will prime your brain
    and engage your curiosity. It becomes a game of discovery rather than completion.
