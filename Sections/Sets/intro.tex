    \textbf{Opening Questions:} What do we call a collection of things?
    does order or repetition matter? Can we contain collection of other collections? Is an empty collection
    considered a collection? How do we count members of a collection, and how do we define them? Can we
    combine collections, and if so, what are those operations?
