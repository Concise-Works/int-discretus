        \textbf{Summary:} A \textbf{set} is a collection of `things' or objects. An object that is a member of a set is an
        \textbf{element} $4\in\mathbb{Z}$. In a set \textbf{order and
            repetition do not matter}. Sets can contain other sets, these subsections/slices/portions are
        called \textbf{subsets}. An \textbf{empty set} is denoted $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$.\\

        \noindent
        \textbf{Cardinality} is the element
        count of a set, it does not count sets beyond the top layer. $\{1, {2, 3}\}$ has a cardinality of 2, not 3.
        \textbf{set-roster} notation is the explicit listing of a set like $\{...,1,2,3,...\}$. \textbf{set-builder}
        notation is the description of a set $\{x\in \mathbb{Z} | x \textbf{ is even}\}$.\\

        \noindent
        Combining two sets is called a \textbf{union},
        the \textbf{intersection} is the common elements between two sets. The \textbf{cartesian product} of two sets is the set of all possible
        ordered pairs. The \textbf{difference} between sets $A$ and $B$ are elements in $A$ that are not in $B$. There
        are many more operations that we could discuss, but we will just stick to these for now.
