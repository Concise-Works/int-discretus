\subsection{Introduction to Functions}
To talk about functions, is to talk about relationships. Take the `<' sign, this is a relationship.
$x < y$ means $x$ relates to $y$, such that $x$ is less than $y$.\\

\noindent
Let $A=\{1,2,3,4\}$ and $B=\{3,4,5,6\}$\\

\begin{tikzpicture}
    % Draw the sets
    \draw[black] (-3,0) ellipse (1.5 and 2.5);
    \draw[black] (2,0) ellipse (1.5 and 2.5);

    % Labels for the elements in the first set
    \node at (-3,1.5) {1};
    \node at (-3,.5) {2};
    \node at (-3,-.5) {3};
    \node at (-3,-1.5) {4};
    \node at (2,-2.5) {$A$};

    % Labels for the elements in the second set
    \node at (2,1.5) {3};
    \node at (2,.5) {4};
    \node at (2,-.5) {5};
    \node at (2,-1.5) {6};

    % Draw the arrow
    \draw[->, purple] (-1.5,0.5) .. controls (0,1) .. (1.5,0);

\end{tikzpicture}
